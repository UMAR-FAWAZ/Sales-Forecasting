# Time Series Forecasting  

## Project Title

Predicting Store Sales to Enhance Decision-Making Using Machine Learning with Time Series Data

## Overview


Precise sales prediction holds significant importance for businesses in diverse sectors, offering numerous advantages that enhance decision-making and overall business efficacy. Accurate sales forecasting can lead to optimized inventory control, efficient resource allocation (like human resources, production capacity, and marketing budgets), streamlined production schedules, and effective marketing strategies, among others.

## Objective 

The **Goal** of this project is to develop a model that can predict unit sales more accurately for numerous items sold across various Favorita stores.

## Installation

To set up the project locally and reproduce the results, follow the steps below:
First navigate to the directory to be used for the project, open the terminal(you can type "cmd" in the path bar to open terminal from the folder):

1. Create a new python virtual environment:

```console
python -m venv *venv_name*
```
2. Activate your *venv_name* :
```console
.\venv_name\Scripts\activate
```
3. clone project repo with git clone command [git clone https://github.com/UMAR-FAWAZ/time-series-project.git]

4. Install the dependencies in the requirement.txt
```console
(venv_name) pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Now you can experiment with the codes.
